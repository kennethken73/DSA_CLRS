* Project - Overview: DSA\_CLRS
** Following CLRS book and sharing the experience on discord
** The Various Data Structures and Algorithms will be together on this one project
** Project - Current Status
Ground-work laid for creation and usage of algorithms, chosen at run-time.
*** Example Run:
#+begin_src elisp :exports both
  (shell-command-to-string projectile-project-run-cmd) 
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: Welcome to the DSA-runner
: What Data Structure are we setting up?
: Available Algorithms:
: myAdd, myMult, 
: algo: myAdd, params: 4,20 --> 24


** Project - Specifics
*** tree

*** how to build, compile, and run
This build system is integrated with spacemacs.
**** build/compile:
run (cmake-ide-compile) while in DSA\_CLRS.cpp
I have (cmake-ide-compile) bound to =,cc=
**** run:
run (omen-c/cpp-project-run-interactive-executable) while in DSA\_CLRS.cpp
I have (omen-c/cpp-project-run-interactive-executable) bound to =<Spc> ocr=

Remember to export to markdown from README.org
* C++ Project - Main Features
** Emacs Development Environment
*** Magit
*** lsp-mode
*** DAP-mode debugging
*** org-mode
**** literate programming
**** org-export with pandoc and markdown integration
*** dir-locals configuration
*** projectile configuration
*** non-conflicting with installed emacs packages
*** TODO
+ get Doxygen set up
+ get clang-format set up
** CMake Build Management
*** TODO
+ get clean-target working
+ set up running an input file into the main executable
  + this will be our testing method
  + so, we'll need a cmake target which reads from /test
