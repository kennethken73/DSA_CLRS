*** how to build, compile, and run
This build system is integrated with spacemacs.
**** build/compile:
run (cmake-ide-compile) while in DSA_CLRS.cpp
I have (cmake-ide-compile) bound to ,cc
**** run:
***** run non-interactively (if no input is needed)
run (omen-c/cpp-project-run-executable) while in DSA_CLRS.cpp
I have (omen-c/cpp-project-run-executable) bound to <Spc> ocr
****** TODO I might remove this function in favor of the following function
***** run interactively (if input is needed)
run (omen-c/cpp-project-run-interactive-executable) while in DSA_CLRS.cpp
I have (omen-c/cpp-project-run-interactive-executable) bound to <Spc> ocm
